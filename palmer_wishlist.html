<h1>My Wish List</h1>
<p>This, of course, is only the Top 4...Note: this list is entirely mutable and will likely be completely different tomorrow.</p>
<ol>
<h2><li><em>Time!</em></li></h2>

<p>Cuz really ~ who ever has enough time? Billionaire Mark Cuban says it's the only commodity needed to succeed that you can't buy, build, make or retrieve. "Use what you have left wisely."

<h2><li><em>A Place with That View!</em></li></h2>
    <img src="the%20view.jpg">
<p>It never gets old: the first cup of coffee, and a stroll outside onto a deck or patio ~ checking out the view of the bay, the city, the Golden Gate, or the Headlands. It almost doesn't matter which. In the 50 years I have come and gone from here, I've never seen a better view.

<h2><li><em>A Weird and Wonderful Garden</em></li></h2>
    <img src="wishgarden.jpg">
<p>I want cool art, southern exposure, stuff growing that you can't always get at the store (cinnamon basil, lemon cucumbers, etc.), and of course ~ the mandatory water feature.

<h2><li><em>A Weekend Warrior Buggy</em></li></h2>
    <img src="the%20car.jpg">
<p>...for the sheer hell of it. While you're wishing, why not wish for a new Jaguar, right? Mine would actually be covertible, with the <em>optional 6 speed</em> transmission.
