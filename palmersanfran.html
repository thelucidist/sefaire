        San Francisco: The Best and the Worst
        </h1>
        
        <h2>
        The <em>best</em> neighborhood is Noe Valley
        </h2>
        
        <p>
        I like <strong>Noe Valley</strong> because it's got great old houses and cool little shopping streets ~ It's removed yet still close to everything.

        <h2>
        The <em>worst</em> neighborhood is the TL 
        </h2>
        
        <p>
        <strong>The Tenderloin</strong> is a drag because ~ lets face it ~  it's depressing.
